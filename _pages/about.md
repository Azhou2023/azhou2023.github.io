Hi! I am a third-year Computer Science / Applied Mathematics undergraduate student at UC San Diego. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Rose Yu](https://roseyu.com/) and [Dr. Michael K. Gilson](https://gilson.cloud.ucsd.edu/) in researching the application of machine learning to problems in small-molecule drug discovery. My current research focus is on exploring agentic function-calling frameworks for multi-objective ligand optimization. My primary research interests are in deep generative modeling, AI4Science, LLMs, and computational drug discovery.
